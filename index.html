<h1>Human Eye Movements</h1>

<div id="muscles-sidebar"><h3>Extraocular muscles</h3><p>The eye movements are controlled by a system of <strong>six</strong><br> extraocular muscles that form
three complementary pairs.<br><br> 
To understand how these muscles move the eyeball, <br>it is
essential to understand the <strong>geometry</strong> of the eye<br> and the <strong>functions</strong> of the muscles. </p>

<p>The quality of vision is better in a certain area in the <strong>center of the retina (fovea)</strong>. However, the small size of this area (about 1.5 mm diameter) doesnâ€™t allow detection of a big part of the visual field. The anatomy of human eye, gives us the ability to observe objects in the world, but if we want to examine one of them we have to move fovea to it. This function is performed by the gaze system.</p>

<p><strong>The main function of the gaze system is to capture images of the surrounding environment towards the fovea area, and also stabilize the image even when the object moves or the head moves.</strong> <br><br>

There are three subsystems:</p> 

<ul class="subsystems">
  <li><a href="#ocu-sys">The Oculomotor system</a></li>
  <li><a href="#fix-sys">The Fixation system</a></li>
  <li><a href="#head-sys">The Head Movement system</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="ocul-whole"><h2 id="ocu-sys">Oculomotor system</h2>

<img id="sac-pic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Szakkad.jpg" alt="saccades during staring at a face" width="300">

<p id="oculomotor-info">The oculomotor system, supports the observation of steady and not-steady images, as it is responsible for the movements of the <strong>eyes in the orbit</strong>. The oculomotor system is responsible for three kind of ocular movements:</p> 
<ol class="oculomotor">
  <li>The saccades</li> 
  <li>The smooth pursuit movements</li>
  <li>The vergence movements</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2 id="fix-sys">Fixation system</h2>

<img id="microsac-pic" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f98c287cf46fd497813add3156ebb8f4.webp" alt="view of tremor, drifts and microsaccades" width="200">

<div class="three-fix"><p>The three primary types of movements during visual fixations are:</p>
<ol class="fixation">
  <li>Tremor</li>
  <li>Drifts</li>
  <li>Microsaccades</li>
</ol>
</div>
  
<p id="fix-info"><strong>Human eyes are continually moving, even while our gaze system fixates on a target.</strong> Eye movements during fixations, are <em>involuntary</em> and very significant for our vision.<br><br> 
We are able to detect stationary objects in the surrounding environment as neurons in the retina, mainly detect and compare changes in luminance and other aspects of objects, while in the other hand stationary images are ignored.<br><br></p>
  
<div id="head-whole"><h2 id="head-sys">Head Movement system</h2>

<img id="vesti-pic" src="https://www.wikilectures.eu/images/3/30/Vestibulo_ocular_reflex.jpg" alt="vestibulo-ocular reflex" width="400">

<p id="head-info">The abovementioned movements happen when the head is still, but usually when we look around our <strong>head is moving.</strong><br><br> The size of the voluntary and involuntary movements of head affects the amplitude and direction of eye movements.</p>

<p>The head movement system, is controlled by two sub-systems:</p> 
<ol class="head">
  <li>The vestibular-ocular system</li>
  <li>The optokinetic system</li>
</ol>
